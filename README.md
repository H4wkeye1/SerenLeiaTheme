# LeiaSerenTheme
A modification of the great AuraMod Seren Theme by SerpentDrago, which you can find here. All credit goes to him for making this theme.

The AZ Leia skin mod is made by beatmasterRS and can be found here

Some textures used in the theme have been taken from AZ 2 mod made by jurialmunkey and the skin can be found here

All credits go to their respective owners. I only modified/built upon their work.

I've modified it to work on Arctic Zephyr Leia Mod skin, and added some minor visual/color adjustments. Still has bugs, a work in progress. Play Next is still broken atm.
